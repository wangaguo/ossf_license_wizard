When you, as the licensor (hereafter “you” for short), release your own software program under a free/open source software license, the following common conditions apply:
(1)that you will provide the source code of the program;
(2)that you grant users the rights to use, reproduce, distribute and modify the program;
(3)that you grant those rights without license fee;
(4)that there is no specific licensee;
(5)that the rights are granted worldwide;
(6)that the license is non-exclusive, therefore you can still have different licenses with different parties;
(7)that the license does not come with any guarantee or warranty and this exempts you from unnecessary legal responsibilities.
(8)that your program can be sold commercially.

This License Wizard Version 2 helps you choose a free/open source software license that suits your needs. We have picked up a number of the most popular licenses on which we have conducted an in-depth research. Note this does not cover every kind of license and every kind of need. What this License Wizard suggests should be treated as a guideline. A number of resources you can refer to include: “Comparison of Different Free/Open Source Software Licenses”, “FAQ on Free/Open Source Software Licenses”, and “A Glossary of Free/Open Source Software-Related Legal Terms”. You can find other licenses approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) at their official site.
Before we start, please allow us to remind you that computer programs and related documentations are subject to the protection under Copyright Law. If your software program has made use of other people’s program code, or if your software program is a result of modifying other people’s program, please make sure that you also follow the set of rules of the license(s) under which the program(s) is (are) involved.

			<Text>Do you require that source code be given when the software program is redistributed?</Text>
			<Description>After you have released your software program on OpenFoundry, if the licensees make the program available for download on sites other than OpenFoundry, or if they redistribute the program in forms such as CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, do you require they offer the source code to other users?</Description>
			<Answers>
				<Answer value="Y" nextQuestion="Q6">
					<Text>Yes</Text>
					<Description>Although the licensees do not necessarily have to offer the source code when they redistribute it, but if someone asks them, they have to do so. This ensures that source code is always available for using, modification and further circulation.</Description>

				<Answer value="N" nextQuestion="Q6">
					<Text>NO, I don’t require the source code be provided.</Text>
					<Description>The licensees can turn down the request for source code. This may attract commercial entities to make use of your program and develop other projects upon it. This can also have positive contribution to the popularity of your program.</Description>

			<Text>Do you agree to let your software program be sublicensed by the licensees? (You can refer to the Glossary of Free/Open Source Software-Related Legal Terms for the meaning of sublicensing, under the term “sublicense.”)</Text>
			<Answers>
				<Answer value="Y" nextQuestion="Q4-1">
					<Text>YES , I agree.</Text>
					<Description> One of the advantages of agreeing on sublicensing is that if other users have any problem, they don’t need to contact you or the orginator of the license. Rather they just contact the licensee who sublicenses the software program. This is especially helpful for programmers or companies that wish to serve their customers directly, as this saves people from complicated rights relationship.</Description>

			<Text>您要求再散布程式時所收取的費用有所限制嗎？</Text>
			<Description>再散佈程式（以及原始碼）有時候會需要一定的成本，所以為了不造成再散佈程式的使用者太大的負擔，通常會允許收取若干費用，但某些使用者也可能會透過販賣您的專案程式去牟利，您希望這些使用者在提供您的專案程式給其他人使用時所收取的費用要有一定的限制嗎？</Description>

				<Answer value="N" nextQuestion="Q9">
					<Text>否，不需要對使用者收取的費用加以限制。</Text>
					<Description>不需要限制對使用者再散布程式時所收取的金額，因為金額多寡可以透過市場機制來決定，這樣一方面可以提高使用者繼續散佈專案程式的意願，同時也可能讓更多人有機會能夠可以接觸到您的專案程式。</Description>

		<Question id="Q7">
			<Text>If the distributed program does not include source code and the source code is provided through other means, do you allow the fee charged for the distributed source code to exceed the cost of distributing the source code?</Text>
			<Description> In principle, there is no limitation of the fee charged for the distributed source code, but some licenses have special regulation: If the licensee only distributes the executable binary of the program and provides the source code through other means, do you agree that the licensee can charge other people a fee higher than the cost of distributing the source code, or even make a profit from selling the program?</Description>
			<Answers>
				<Answer value="Y" nextQuestion="Q9">
					<Text>YES, I agree. </Text>
					<Description> The licensee can make a profit by selling the source code of my project at will. Market competition provides stimulus for other users to buy the program.</Description>
